## 2. Information We Collect
 We collect and process the following types of personal information:

- **Personal Identifiers:** Your name and email address are required to create and manage your Sayote account. Your email address serves as your unique identifier when acquiring a Sayote membership.
- **Master Profile Information:** You may choose to provide additional information within your Master Profile, including but not limited to your profile picture(s), contact information (e.g., address, phone number, social media handles), and a brief biography. The extent of this information shared with other users is determined by you and may vary between different groups.
- **Group Membership Information:** We maintain records of the groups you belong to, your role within each group (e.g., Group Manager, member, etc.), and any permissions granted to you by the Group Manager.

## 3. Use of Information
 We use your personal information to:

- **Manage Your Account:** Facilitate your use of Sayote by identifying your account, addressing you by name, and allowing you to manage your Master Profile and group memberships.
- **Provide Group Functionality:** Enable the creation and management of groups, including the ability to share specific elements of your Master Profile with selected groups, as determined by you.
- **Security and Integrity:** Ensure that content shared within Sayote groups complies with our ethical standards and terms of service. This includes automated monitoring and, where necessary, human review of content flagged for potential violations.

- **Protection of Rights:** We may disclose your information to protect our rights, property, or safety, as well as that of our users or the public.
- **Group Information:** Information within your Master Profile will only be shared with groups you have chosen to share it with. Each group operates as a distinct silo, and information is not shared between groups unless explicitly permitted by you.

- **Content Monitoring:** We may employ automated systems to review content for compliance with our standards. In cases where content is flagged, we may reject or remove it. Users may also report inappropriate content for further review.

## 6. Security
 We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes encryption of data both in transit and at rest.

By clicking the “I Agree” button, downloading, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not click the “I Agree” button, download, or use the Service.

This Agreement constitutes a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Hive 604 Ltd., located at 5952 237A St, Langley, BC, Canada, V2Z 1A6, and governs your use of the Service made available by Hive 604 License

## 1. License

Hive604 grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install, and use the Service strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

## 2. Restrictions

Sayote has no age restrictions, because we do not sell, lend, share, trade, or otherwise use personal data. It stays in the group it was added to; we do no data-mining. Also, we show no advertisements. Plus, the only way to join a group is to be invited. No anonymous people, and no bots or trolls can join a group. And if somebody does act in a non-social way, the GM (Group Manager) can remove them permanently.

You agree not to, and you will not permit others to:

- **License, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, disclose, or otherwise commercially exploit the Service** or make the Service available to any third party.
